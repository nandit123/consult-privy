# consult-privy
The aim of this ZCash based app is to allow users to consult a health professional in a private manner for health issues without revealing their identity. In today's age many people are facing mental health issues like depression and anxiety which they shy to talk to health professionals. Our app could be used to help solve this problem
## Use of ZCash Memos
Our app aims to use shielded transactions and using memos as a way to chat about the health issues. The address of the health professionals will be available to the user where the user can do a ZCash transaction with some ZEC and mentioning his health issue in the memo. The health professional will recieve the transaction with memo without the identity of the user and then can revert back to the user with the problem solution.
